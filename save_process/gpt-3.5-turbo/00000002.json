Enforcement of model redundancy. \n\nFinancial modeling standards provide several benefits such as improved quality and transparency, decreased development time and costs, and minimization of error risk. However, enforcing model redundancy is not typically considered a benefit of financial modeling standards. Model redundancy refers to unnecessary duplication or repetition within a model, which can lead to inefficiencies and potential errors. Financial modeling standards aim to streamline and optimize the modeling process, rather than enforce redundancy."}
