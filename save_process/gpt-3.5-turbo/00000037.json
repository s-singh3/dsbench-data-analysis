A lower credit rating than senior tranches and lower associated risk\n\nJunior tranches of a Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) typically have a lower credit rating than senior tranches due to their position in the payment hierarchy. However, they may offer higher potential returns to compensate for the increased risk associated with these lower credit ratings. Despite the lower credit rating, junior tranches may have lower associated risk compared to senior tranches because they absorb losses first in case of defaults on the underlying assets."}
