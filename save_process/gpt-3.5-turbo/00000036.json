The formula for the diminishing balance method is:\n\nDepreciation Rate = 1 - (Residual Value / Cost of Asset) ^ (1 / Useful Life)\n\nGiven:\nCost of Asset = $18,000\nUseful Life = 5 years\n\nAssuming a residual value of 0 for this calculation, the depreciation rate would be:\n\nDepreciation Rate = 1 - (0 / 18000) ^ (1 / 5)\nDepreciation Rate = 1 - 0 ^ 0.2\nDepreciation Rate = 1 - 0\nDepreciation Rate = 1\n\nSince the depreciation rate is 1, the depreciation expense each year will be the same, which is calculated as:\n\nDepreciation Expense = Depreciation Rate * Book Value at the Beginning of the Year\n\nAfter 3 years, the book value of the asset can be calculated as follows:\n\nYear 1:\nDepreciation Expense = $18,000 * 1 = $18,000\nBook Value at the End of Year 1 = $18,000 - $18,000 = $0\n\nYear 2:\nDepreciation Expense = $0 * 1 = $0\nBook Value at the End of Year 2 = $0 - $0 = $0\n\nYear 3:\nDepreciation Expense = $0 * 1 = $0\nBook Value at the End of Year 3 = $0 - $0 = $0\n\nTherefore, after 3 years, the asset's book value using the diminishing balance method would be $0. \n\nTherefore, the closest answer to the asset's book value after 3 years from the options provided is d. $2,000."}

Loan amortization payments are accounted for in the income statement as an expense but do not affect the cash position of the firm."}
