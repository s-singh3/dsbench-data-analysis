INTRODUCTION
Youâ€™ve been asked to prepare a model to forecast the performance of a multiple tranche debt facility that 
will be drawn by an investment fund to purchase assets.  The facility is only drawn when it is needed to 
finance the purchasing of an asset in to the fund, and each asset purchased will map to its own tranche in 
the facility. 
 
TRANCHE DETAILS 
The facility is forecast to have 4 tranches. Details of each tranche are given in the table over page. 
 
INTEREST BASIS AND TIMING ASSUMPTIONS 
Assume that all interest is calculated on a 30/360 basis on the opening daily balance.  All interest rates 
given are simple annual rates (not effective-annual compounding rates). All cash flows, payment dates 
and interest accrual dates occur on calendar quarter end dates.
