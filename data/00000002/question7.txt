Question 7 During a Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) transaction, the ability to find and use good comparable data for a valuation is? a. Relatively easy because each successful company within an industry uses the same ratios b. Relatively easy because public stock price fluctuation is not sufficient or erratic enough to make a difference c. Relatively difficult because book value is adjusted in small companies as FIFO (first-in first-out) is the method of choice and in public companies book value is static due to LIFO (last-in-first our method) d. d. Relatively difficult because size differential, management depth product diversity and access to lines of credit will seldom match the company you are valuing
